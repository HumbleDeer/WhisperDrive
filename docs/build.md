# Building the board

The board is (planned to be) designed with the DIY builder in mind. The component choice was made to be both easy to source, easy to design around, as well as still easy enough to solder with somewhat common tools.

## Tools

The required set of tools is fairly minimal and exists out of both essential tools as well as nice-to-have tools.  
If you're an experienced electronics builder, you may already plan to deviate from these tools and that is fine. You do you, you know you best.

The recommended toolset for this board consists of:

- A soldering iron  
  - A chisel tip is a must-have
  - 60W or more is recommended
- Leaded solder is preferred  
  - Sn/Pb 63/37 (eutectic mix) is ideal
  - Don't buy cheap solder from China!  
    It's easy to buy really crappy solder and feel disappointed in yourself, when in reality it's the solder being a royal pain in the arse.
